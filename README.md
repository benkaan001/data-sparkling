# Data Cleaning Projects using Databricks

This repository contains a number of data cleaning projects using PySpark and Databricks.

## About Databricks

[Databricks](https://databricks.com/) is a unified data analytics platform that provides a collaborative workspace for data engineering, data science, and machine learning. It provides a cloud-based environment for big data processing that enables users to easily build and deploy machine learning models at scale.

## About the Projects

The data cleaning projects in this repository are intended to showcase different techniques for cleaning and transforming data using Databricks. Each project is contained in its own Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.

The projects cover a range of data cleaning techniques, including handling missing values, data transformation, feature engineering, and more. Each project is designed to be easily understood and modified, so that users can experiment with different approaches and learn from the code.

Some of the data in this repository was generated using web scraping techniques with Pandas. For more information on how this was done, you can refer to my [Pandas repository](https://github.com/benkaan001/pandas_and_beyond/tree/main/generate_data), which contains code for generating synthetic data with pandas and other data manipulation techniques.


## Getting Started

To get started with the projects, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project file you are interested in. Each project file is made of  a Jupyter notebook that can be opened in Databricks. You will need to have a Databricks account and workspace set up to run the notebooks.

To create a free community-edition Databricks account, please follow this [link](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html). This will take you to the Databricks community-edition sign-up page, where you can create an account and start using Databricks for your data engineering and data science projects.


## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a new data cleaning project that you would like to add, please create a new folder with a README file and Jupyter notebook, and submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the data used in these projects is either synthetic or publicly available, and is not intended to represent real-world data. The projects are designed to showcase different data cleaning techniques, and should not be used to make business or financial decisions.
